## Bharti_hackathon

The project is a platform designed to streamline and personalize teacher-student or teacher-admin interactions. 

Progress So Far
1. Basic UI Development:
   - We’ve developed a minimal user interface, including a login button for authentication.
   - The backend leverages Clerk for user authentication. 

2. User Profile Management:
   - Currently, when users log in, their profiles are created and stored in Clerk and subsequently saved in MongoDB.
  
3. Role-Based Features:
   - While we have a functioning login and profile creation flow, role-based personalization for admin and teachers is not yet implemented.

Next Steps to implement
- Teacher Profiles: Data such as skills, subject expertise, teaching style, and availability will form the basis for teacher profiles.
- Key functionalities which include:  
1.⁠ ⁠Real-time teacher matching based on subject expertise, availability, and preferences.  
2.⁠ ⁠A request submission system for schools with instant notifications to substitutes.  
3.⁠ ⁠Automated scheduling and meeting link generation (e.g., Google Meet/Zoom API).  
4.⁠ ⁠A dashboard for schools to track requests and for teachers to manage availability.
